# Second order polynomial equation solver

A small personal project that solves the equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0. It takes user input for the coefficients of a, b and c and then returns the equation they inputted and the solution to that equation. This project was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, runs on an express server and is templated using handlebars.
